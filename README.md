# SortIntegersInFile
A group of python scripts that is used to create random value integers in a text file and sort them.   

createIntegerFile.py creates random value integers (number of integers in a line and number of lines must be entered as parameters) and writes them into integers.txt. Do not call this if integers.txt already exists.

SortInFile.py (not finished) sorts numbers in integers.txt.
